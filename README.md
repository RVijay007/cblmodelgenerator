### BACKGROUND

This is a command line interface (CLI) to generate Couchbase Lite models from a Core Data file.

### INSTALLATION

1.  Clone the repository to your local drive

### USAGE

Pass in the path to your Core Data model directory, e.g. ```.xcdatamodeld``` as the only argument to the command line.

Make sure your Core Data Model ```.xcdatamodeld``` is NOT included in any targets for your app as the file will be invalid in many cases.
